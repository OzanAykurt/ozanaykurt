# Hi 👋, I'm Ozan Aykurt
<br> 🌱 I'm a junior developer. <br>
<br> 🎓 I'm about to finish an associate degree. (Istanbul Kultur University, Computer Programming) <br>
<br> 🎯 I aim to use GitHub more actively, but as I'll be graduating this semester, I'll be occupied with my graduation project. <br>
Once it's completed, I'll upload it here.<br>
<br> 🖥️ Also, I have a personal website where I write blog posts about new things I've learned. -> [ozanaykurt.com](https://www.ozanaykurt.com/en) <br>
I'm using a ready-made website for now, but as soon as I get the chance, I'll code this one myself :) <br>
